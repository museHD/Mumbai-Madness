## About the Project:
üë©‚Äçüíª This is a endless 2D car game written in Python for a Year 9 Information & Software Technology Assessment. 

It is a very simple game where the user moves the car horizontally to dodge oncoming potholes. As any endless runer, the longer you can go, the higher score you get. 

Please keep in mind this is some of my very early code from when I started programming, so it's not refined in any way.
Although the project has been assessed, it's still fun to play around with once in a while. Please feel free to leave any feedback! ‚ù§Ô∏è

There are lots of improvements to be made for first timer contributors so if you are interested in improving it, see <a href="#contributing">Contributing.</a>
